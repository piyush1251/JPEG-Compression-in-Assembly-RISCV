# JPEG-Compression-in-Assembly-RISCV
# JPEG Compression via Assembly Language for RISC-V32I using RARS simulation Tool

## Project Overview
This project aims to implement JPEG compression using assembly language specifically for the RISC-V32I architecture. The focus is on creating an efficient, low-level algorithm to compress JPEG images, leveraging the unique features and capabilities of the RISC-V32I instruction set. RARS simulation tool was used for implementation and testing.

## Features
- **Efficient Compression Algorithm**: Utilizes custom assembly routines for optimal performance.
- **RISC-V32I Optimization**: Tailored specifically for the RISC-V32I architecture to take full advantage of its instruction set.
- **Minimalistic Design**: Strives for a clean, understandable codebase with a focus on performance and maintainability.
